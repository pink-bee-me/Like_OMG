                <h4 style="text-align:center; color:orchid;text-shadow:1px 1px 1px cornsilk; font-variant:petite-caps;">Within this age old idiom lies a simple truth;  the most detrimental mistake made while attempting any endeavor, is failure to give proper attention to the small details that make up each aspect of that endeavor.</h4>
                <h5> <span id="details">Attention to detail (or lack
                    there of)</span> directly impacts the level of success any endeavor can possibly hope to acheive. This correlation between the level of success acheivable and the amount of attention paid to the details is applicable to all endeavors, no matter how big or small. The probablitiy of success and the quality of the attention paid to details are, in fact, directly proportionate. In short, the only thing that differentiates the "Great" from the "Good"  and the "Good" from the "Bad" is the degree of completeness that is applied to the careful consideration of the details and the possible implications, the various affects, and the scope of these implications, and the way these things factor  in  and influence the outcome of the project. Failing to pay attention to detail is like purposely choosing to be mediocre at best. Where you had expected to produce an outcome that brought you great pride, instead
                    you find yourself sitting there, dazed and confused, shaking your head, realizing that in your rush  you made the choice to be less than stellar, ... or even worse, possibly offending the very audience you were trying to impress! On the other hand,... by paying attention to the details, making a point to give every aspect of your project careful consideration, it gives you the ability to tranform what may seem like an average idea at first glance, into something that is MAGNIFICENT!!!  The take away here is this: Whatever one does should be done thoroughly; details are important.  "God is in the detail", the original version of the aforementioned idiom, means that attention paid to small things brings forth big rewards... with this in mind, I believe it is fair to say that when you take the time to pay attention to the details you literally raise the bar with regard to the level of success that is possible to acheive , while also greatly increasing the probablity of  taking that possibility and making it your reality!!!</h5>

                    <p> My inquisitive nature and love of learning are assets that serve me well day in and day out as
                        my quest for adventure continues to unfold in the magical world that is computer programming.
                        While coding serves as the key to gain entry into to this exciting world where anything is
                        possible; critical thinking skills which include: determining if there is a problem, identifying
                        the problem, determine ways to solve the problem, create a plan to solve the problem, consider
                        the effects of the solution, and the skills bring your plan to life. On top of that, being open
                        to ideas that are not your own, being considerate of perspectives that may differ from your own,
                        and an unwaving determination to perserve through obstacles no matter how big or small,... these
                        are the attributes that are required to fully appreciate and eperience the magic available in
                        the world of computer programming Not everyone wants to gain entry into the magical world,...
                        but for those of us that do, the hard work that is necessary to gain the skills to become a part
                        of this magical world and experience it in all its glory is well worth it. Along the way you
                        forge friendships and witness a comraderie that is as great as the adventures you seek.
                        Never a dull moment: There is always something new to learn and challenges waiting to be
                        tackled, ... with computer programming the possibilities are endless and that definitely keeps
                        things interesting. Creative thinking coupled with crtical thinking takes both a skill and an
                        art and gives the engineer a newly found freedom to explore creative avenues as they search for
                        solutions to problems. In today's world, creativly solving problems whether new or old is not an
                        option but a necessity. The consumer craves the new and exciting and as developers we must find
                        a way that satisfys both the functional issues of a problem and also make it pleasing on a
                        creative level to appeal to the market that it serves. That is what the "Art of Coding" means to
                        me. Coding is the ultimate place to utilize that skill set. Learning to code, finding solutions
                        to problems, and then being able to create a program that implements that solution in a way that
                        is beautiful and interesting and makes people want to be connected in someway to your creation
                        is beyond satisfying. This is the reason that I wake up every morning eagar to tackle whatever
                        obstacles may get in my way. I can honestly say that I look forward to each day and the
                        adventure that it will bring. There is always something new to discover in the world of coding.
                        For as long as I can remeber, I have enjoyed fixing things that are broken, figuring out how
                        things work, experimenting and making improvements and when possible upgrading design features
                        and processes as I went along... Today these are still the things that make me happy. Coding
                        lets me use the things I am good at, to do the thing that interests me most, and gives me the
                        privilege of serving others by helping solve problems through computer programming. The
                        possibility that my code can make a little part of someone's life better, even if it is just a
                        little bit... that makes me feel amazing. Coding makes me feel like I can make a differnece in
                        this world. Coding gives me a sence of purpose and a sense responsibility to hold myself
                        accountable to use my God- given talents in the best way possible. My hope if that through code
                        I will help solve problems and make things that make a difference in some way, whether big or
                        small ... if I can bring a smile to someone's face and make their day a little better in some
                        way then that will make things even betVVVVVVVVVter! </p>
